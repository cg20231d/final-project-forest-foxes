# Explanation of the project

This project is used to show how a certain atoms goes through what is called a decay. and in a group of said atom, when the half life time had passes, there would remain half of them left. while the other half have change into a more stable molecule. For example Polonium atom (Pl-210 or Pl-211) have a half-life time of 138.376 days and its decay is alpha decay meaning they lose one alpha particle (equal to a Helium atom with mass of 4). Polonium then changed into Lead (Pb-206 or Pb-207 respectively) which are more stable in nature than Polonium. 

![The scientific equation of the process](https://github.com/cg20231d/final-project-forest-foxes/assets/89778375/5df519a3-b8ba-4476-b246-040a56afbbde)

so there goes the theory.</br>

# Technology and implementation

This project is a 3D replication from what is shown in [This phet simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/alpha-decay). Using Three.JS we tried to make a 3D view of the phenomenon. While the users can change the value of the lifetime. And when the decay occurs, the atom will release a shockwave of energy, which is also being simulated. 

# Difficulties and problem

While doing this project, we came across a few difficulties along the way, such as not enough memory (Alfadito problem) so he can't exactly see what Charles had done. so in trying to make it up. he, Alfadito, is the one writing this readme.
